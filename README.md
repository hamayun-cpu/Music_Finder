## Concept
> Telegram-bot, Most popular attributes from Telegram is the possibility of creating your own bot that do whatever you want. I have created a bot which will give you music recomendations in the form of youtube links according the type you want, for example if you want to listen to love songs just type /love and it will give you link to love music.
